    "RL Policy Gradient (PG) methods are model-free methods that try to maximize the RL objective directly without requiring a value function. Although a value function can be used as a baseline for variance reduction, or in order to evaluate current and successor state's value (Actor-Critic), it is not required for the purpose of action selection. The RL objective or the performance measure $J(\\theta)$ is defined as the sum of rewards from the initial state to a terminal state for the episodic task, and the average return for the continuing task. We are trying to fit an ANN parametrized by $\\theta$ to learn a stochastic policy $\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s_t)$, a probability distribution mapping from state to actions, that will maximize $J(\\theta)$.\n",

    "## Relevant RL concepts\n",
    "- **Policy**: a mapping from states to action probabilities. Following a policy $\\pi$ means that at each timestep $t$ when beeing at state $s_t$ we select an action $a$ with probability $\\pi(a|s_t)$. The notation $\\pi^*$ represents the optimal policy for a task, which is the policy that yields the highest expected reward.\n",
    "- **Value function**: a function that estimates the expected future reward.\n",
    "- **State-Value ($V$) function**: $\\hat{v}_\\pi(s)$ is a value function that estimates $v_\\pi(s)$, the expected reward starting at a state $s$ and following policy $\\pi$ onwards. The notation $v_{\\pi^*}(s)$ represent the true state-value for the optimal policy $\\pi^*$. \n",
    "- **State-Action Value ($Q$) function**: $\\hat{q}_\\pi(s, a)$ is a value function that estimates $q_\\pi(s, a)$, the expected reward of applying action $a$ at state $s$ and following policy $\\pi$ onwards. The notation $q_{\\pi^*}(s, a)$ represent the true state-action value for the optimal policy $\\pi^*$.\n",
    "- **State-Value** and **State-Action value methods**: methods that try to estimate the State and State-Action Value functions respectively.\n",
    "- **Greedy policy**: Greedy policy is a policy that fully exploits the current value estimation, meaning it selects the action with the maximal estimated value. If there are multiple actions that have the same maximum value, it chooses an action arbitrarily.\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$**-greedy policy**: $\\epsilon$-greedy policy is a policy that tries to balance between exploration and exploitation, it chooses a greedy action with probability $1-\\epsilon$ and a random action with probability $\\epsilon$. It is common to start with a large $\\epsilon$ value and decrease it during the learning process.\n",
    "- **Episodic Task**: an RL task with terminal states, for which the experience is separated into independent sequences (episodes) of state-reward pairs. All episodes will eventually end in a terminal state regardless of the actions selected.\n",
    "- **Continuing Task**: an RL infinite horizon task that continues indefinitely with no terminal states.\n",
    "- **Trajectory** - A trajectory $\\tau$ is a sequence of continuous timestep state-reward pairs from a single episode. In episodic tasks, this term sometimes describes the full path from the initial state to a terminal state. In other cases, the explicit term Full/Complete trajectory is used.\n",
    "- **Discount rate**: Receiving rewards sooner is better than later. A concept that is essential for an infinite horizon (continuing) task because an infinite sum of finite rewards can be infinite, but can also be applied to episodic tasks. A discount rate $0 \\ge \\gamma \\ge 1$ is a parameter that is used to calculate the present value of future rewards. A reward received $k$ steps in the future is worth $\\gamma^{k-1}$ at the current time step. On the extremes, when $\\gamma=1$ there is no discounting, and $\\gamma=0$ means the agent only cares about immediate rewards.\n",
    "- **Bootstrapping**: A method that updates an estimate for a given value function at a given state based on value estimates of successor states. Dynamic Programming (DP), Temporal-Difference (TD) and Actor-Critic methods use Bootstrapping.\n",
    "- **Environment Dynamics** - In RL we assume that the environment has a transition distribution $p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$ (a.k.a transition function or transition dynamics) that defines the probability to arrive at state $s_{t+1}$ at time $t+1$ after being at state $s_t$ at time $t$ and applying action $a_t$. We also assume that the environment also has a reward distribution $R(r_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$ that defines the probability of receiving reward $r_{t+1}$ when applying action $a_t$ at state $s_t$. These two distributions are usually unknown to us, but we are able to sample from them by interacting with (sampling from) the environment.\n",
    "- **Sampling Methods** - Often it is easy to generate experience sampled from the desired probability distribution but is infeasible to obtain the explicit form of that distribution. Sampling methods do not require a perfect probabilistic model of the environment, they interact with it and create samples of temporal state transitions and rewards.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** a collection of algorithms that computes the optimal policy given a perfect probabilistic model of the environment (state transition, reward probabilities, and termination) as a Markov decision process (MDP). DP methods use bootstrapping but don't use sampling. \n",
    "- **Monte Carlo (MC)**: A sampling method that is defined for episodic tasks. It updates the state/state-action value estimates only when an episode is complete (an exception is the use eligibility traces, for which MC methods can also be applied to continuing tasks and values updates happen online). MC methods are not biased because they actually sample a complete trajectory instead of using a biased value estimate of successor states (they don't bootstrap). Because of the nature of sampling multiple random variables and only updating at the end of the episode, MC methods usually have higher variance compared to methods that update on a step-to-step or n-step basis (e.g. TD methods).\n",
    "- **Temporal Difference (TD) learning**: TD methods combine both MC and DP methods and they are suitable for online step by step learning. Like MC methods they learn by sampling experience directly from the environment and do not require the full model of the environment dynamics, and like DP methods they use successor state value estimates (bootstrap) in order to estimate the current stateâ€™s state/state-action value estimate. TD methods can be calculated for more than a one-step (n-step target) and also be united with Monte Carlo methods (TD($\\lambda$)).\n",
    "- **Tabular methods**: Refers to the use of state-value and State-Action value methods when the state and action spaces are small enough to fit in a table. Tabular methods have no generalization, each state/state-action has its unique value in the table.\n",
    "- **Function Approximation for action/action-value methods**: Methods that can be applied to tasks with arbitrarily large state spaces, for which there is not enough memory for state/state-action tables, or that these tables cannot be filled optimally even in the limit of infinite amounts of time and data. For example, an autonomous car camera will never capture the exact same image but will usually encounter images of scenarios it can generalize (e.g. \"a single pedestrian walking on the zebra crossing\"). For these tasks, an optimal solution cannot be obtained and generalization and finding a good approximated solution with limited compute resources is the goal. Function approximation in RL is related to Supervised Learning, but it also deals with some unique issues such as nonstationarity, bootstrapping, and delayed targets. Although in theory all supervised learning methods can be applied to RL tasks, in practice we will usually use a linear function approximator or artificial neural network (ANN).\n",
    "- **Markov Property**:  A Markov property of a stochastic process is a property of the conditional probability distribution of arrival at future states only depends on the current state and not the past. Meaning that given the current state, the history/path of arriving to it is a redundant information that does not affect the transition distribution: $P(s_t | s_0, s_1,...s_{t-1})=P(s_t | s_{t-1})$.  A Markov chain satisfies the Markov property.\n",
    "- **Stationary Distributions**: The definition of [Stationary Distributions](https://brilliant.org/wiki/stationary-distributions/) comes from Markov Chains and it refers to a probability distribution over the state space of being in a specific state after enough timestamps since starting at the initial state. Stationary Distributions are defined for Ergodic and Absorbing Markov chains. \n",
    "- **Ergodic Markov Chains**: Ergodic Markov chains contain only recurrent states (a state you are guaranteed to return too) and unique stationary distribution. In the context of RL, they represent a continuing task for which all states will be revisited with non-zero probability and a reward distribution for each state that won't vary with time.\n",
    "- **Absorbing Markov Chains**: Absorbing Markov Chains have absorbing states which are states that are impossible to leave. Any path from any given state will eventually reach an absorbing state with non-zero probability. This is the reason that for these types of Markov chains the stationary distributions are non-zero only for absorbing states. In the RL context, episodic task's terminal states can be viewed as absorbing states with infinite zero rewards regardless of the actions chosen.\n",
    "- **Nonstationarity in the context of RL**: RL mainly deals with nonstationary target functions (target functions that change over time) either because the task in itself is nonstationary (e.g. reward probabilities that vary with time), or it is effectively nonstationary (e.g. target policies that change during training, or using bootstrapping with successor state reward estimates that haven't converged yet). This nonstationary nature of targets in reinforcement methods requires function approximation methods that can handle it."

Because PG is a model-free RL method, there isn't a model for the environment dynamics at hand, and we have to sample the environment.

Also, lets first assume that our reward function is constant and intuitive, a positive reward of $+1$ for applying $a_+$ and a negative reward of $-1$ when applying $a_-$. Now suppose that we picked the good action $a_+$ for which the reward is $+1$. In this case, the gradient is the same as in the classification task because we only multiply a constant $+1$ by the cross-entropy loss. We know that in this case, the gradient will try to increase the probability of selecting $a_+$ and reduce the probabilities of $a_-$.

What will happen if we'll multiply the original rewards by $10$, in which actions $a_+$ and $a_-$ will yield a reward of $+10$, $-10$ respectively. What will happen to the gradient? Well, this will only increase the magnitude of the gradient by $10$ but won't change its direction, which is equivalent to increasing our learning rate $\\alpha$ by $10$. Also, the use of gradient clipping can mitigate this effect. But what if we add a constant to the original actions? Adding $+2$ to each of the original values yields a reward of $+3$, $+1$ to $a_+$ and $a_-$. Because the objective is to maximize the future reward, adding a constant should not change the actions' relative goodness. But in practice when using policy gradient, choosing the suboptimal action $a_-$ will also yield a positive reward which will increase the probability of choosing action $a_-$ and thus will make the convergence of the policy network slower. A third issue can arise when a given action has a reward of exactly $0$. In this case, the gradient will be $\\vec{0}$ regardless of its relative goodness. These scenarios can be tackled when using the concept of **Advantage**, which tries to address these relative action goodness issues by reducing the average/expected return from each state."

Because REINFORCE is a Monte Carlo algorithm, it is unbiased but has high variance. It is unbiased because we are sampling from our current policy and interacting with the environment. The reward function is only based on the sum of rewards with no bootstrapping. Thus, if we were to run an infinite number of trajectories starting from $s_0$, the average sum of trajectory rewards will be the true value of $v_{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s_{0})$ which is exactly our objective $J(\\theta)$. \n",

It is called actor-critic because it uses two networks, a policy network (the actor) is used for action selection, and a state-value network (the critic) that is used to evaluate the goodness or the outcome of the selected actions. This sounds similar to the REINFORCE with baseline, right? Like REINFORCE with baseline, it uses a network that evaluates the state-value $\\hat{V}_\\phi^\\pi(s)$. Unlike REINFORCE with baseline, this state-value estimate is not just a baseline. It is used to bootstrap. So, what does it mean to bootstrap? In REINFORCE we sampled the full trajectory and used the actual trajectory's rewards as our value. For the case of using all the variance reduction methods described in the previous sections, our reward function $G_{i, t}$ is the advantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A(s_t, a_t) = (\\sum_{t'=t}^{T-1} \\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})) - \\hat{V}_\\phi^\\pi(s_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "With bootstrapping, we are using an approximation of successor states values instead of sampling the full trajectory. This means that with actor-critic we don't need to wait until the episode ends in order to update the policy network and also, that we can apply PG to continuing tasks. I will present the 1-step or online version of actor-critic, but it can be trivially extended to any desired n-step version. In the online version, at each timestep $t$ when being at state $s_t$ we apply an action $a_t$ that was sampled from the policy and then, observe the reward $r_{t+1}$ and a new state $s_{t+1}$ returned from the environment.\n",
    "The advantage function for the online actor-critic is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A(s_t, a_t) = r(s_{t}, a_{t}) + \\gamma \\hat{V}_\\phi^\\pi(s_{t+1}) - \\hat{V}_\\phi^\\pi(s_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This advantage function is the difference (or error) according to our state-value network, between $\\hat{V}_\\phi^\\pi(s_t)$, our prior expectation of $s_t$'s state-value when following policy $\\pi$, and $r(s_{t}, a_{t}) + \\gamma \\hat{V}_\\phi^\\pi(s_{t+1})$, which is the observed reward $r_{t+1}$ plus the discounted state-value evaluation of the new state $s_{t+1}$. Note that if:\n",

    "\n",
    "Meaning that if we actually had the true state-value function $V_\\pi(s)$ then the expectation of the advantage when following policy $\\pi$ would be equal to $0$. This implies that when exploring new actions getting a positive advantage on average means that we are applying better actions than the actions sampled from $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bias & Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we don't have a perfect estimation of the state-value function because:\n",
    "- We keep changing our policy on-the-fly and do not wait for it to converge to the true value.\n",
    "- Even if we waited enough time, ANN's with nonlinearities aren't convex functions and are unlikely to converge to the true value.\n",
    "- In many interesting cases, the state space is too large that even if someone told us the true state-value we wouldn't have the capacity to store a unique value for each possible state. In these cases and we are actually using an aggregation of states or observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "And therefore, unlike REINFORCE, the advantage estimation is biased. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you probably expect me to say that on the other hand, actor-critic improves the variance... Well, if we are to use the online version described above, we'll be updating the gradient-based on a single environment interaction and that will be a very noisy signal (high variance). We prefer to use batches, and this can be achieved with the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm which I'm not going to dive deep into in this blog post. In a nutshell, it runs multiple agents in parallel and synchronized their gradient signals which reduce the variance."

    "## Advantages of Policy Gradient over action-value methods\n",
    "This is a summary of the advantages of Policy Gradient over action-value given in Sutton and Barto [book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf) chapter 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allows deterministic policies (discrete action space):  \n",
    "The deterministic policy is naturally achieved by a PG method. In case a certain action dominants others, the logit value for this action will be pushed infinitely high, causing this action's softmax value to reach a probability of 1 in the limit. On the contrary, for action-values with an e-greedy policy, there is always an epsilon probability of choosing a random action. Also, trying to achieve exploration by defining a softmax over the action-values will also not allow convergence to a deterministic policy, because the action-values will converge to their true values, which have a finite difference, and therefore all actions will have a non-zero probability. \n",
    "2. Can learn a stochastic policy  \n",
    "In some cases, the policy which yields the highest reward is stochastic. For example, in an imperfect information card game like poker, for which occasionally you choose to bluff. PG methods using an ANN function approximator with a softmax layer can easily output any arbitrary probability over actions, while for action-value methods, the policy is set implicitly by choosing the action with the maximal action value estimate. This inherent maximization makes it impossible for action-value methods to naturally learn a distribution over actions.\n",
    "3. Stronger convergence guarantees due to policy smoothness  \n",
    "Action probability of PG methods changes smoothly when using a continuous policy parametrization (e.g. an ANN model). This is an important theoretical advantage in comparison to the action-value policy, which is set implicitly by the learned action values. This implicit policy is not a smooth function because of the use of maximization to select between actions. A minor increase in a single action-value estimate can make this action's value estimation maximal and significantly increase the probability for that action to be chosen. This theoretical advantage is largely responsible for the stronger convergence guarantees available for PG methods over action-value methods. \n",
    "4. Injecting prior knowledge to policy parametrization   \n",
    "The choice of policy parametrization can be a good way of injecting prior knowledge of the desired form of the policy into the reinforcement learning system. This is often the most important reason for using a policy-based learning method.  \n",
    "\"*The advantages of policy gradient methods for parameterized motor primitives are numerous. Among the most important ones are that the policy representation can be chosen such that it is meaningful for the task, i.e., we can use a suitable motor primitive representation, and that domain knowledge can be incorporated, which often leads to fewer parameters in the learning process in comparison to traditional value function based approaches.\"* [(Reinforcement learning of motor skills with policy gradients)](http://www-clmc.usc.edu/publications/P/peters-NN2008.pdf)"
